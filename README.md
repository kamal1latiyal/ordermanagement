Language and Framework:
I used Node.js with the Express.js framework to implement the web service API for managing orders. For testing, I used the Chai assertion library.

High-level Overview:
The order management system is built as a RESTful API with endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting orders, as well as an endpoint for retrieving all orders. The API accepts and returns JSON data. To store the data, I used a PostgreSQL database, which is provided as a Docker image in the repository.

When a POST request is made to create an order, the system checks if there is a pre-existing order within 3 hours of the requested datetime. If there is, an error is returned. Otherwise, the new order is created and added to the database.

When a PUT request is made to update an order, the system first checks if the order exists. If it does, the system checks if the updated datetime is within 3 hours of any pre-existing orders. If it is, an error is returned. Otherwise, the order is updated.

Trade-offs:
One trade-off I made was to store the order services as an array of service IDs in the order record, rather than a separate table with a foreign key constraint. This simplifies the data model and reduces the number of database queries required for read operations.

Another trade-off was to implement the datetime validation using a simple SQL query rather than a more complex validation function in the API code. While this reduces the amount of API code required, it may make it harder to customize the validation logic in the future.

Assumptions:
I assumed that the system only needs to handle one timezone for all datetime values, and that timezone is UTC.

I also assumed that the service records provided in the sample data are fixed and do not change frequently, so it is reasonable to hardcode them in the API code rather than storing them in the database.

Changes for Production:
If I were building this system for production, I would consider adding more thorough validation and error handling, as well as more robust database transactions to ensure data consistency. I would also consider using an ORM or query builder to simplify database interactions and reduce the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities. Additionally, I would consider implementing rate limiting or other measures to prevent abuse or overloading of the API. I would be using pagination in case of production where we are fetchig all the orders.

Instructions:
To set up the environment and run the project, follow these steps:

Install Docker and Docker Compose if you haven't already.
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
Run the following command to start the PostgreSQL database:

docker-compose up -d

Run the following command to install dependencies:

npm install

Run the following command to start the API server:

nodemon start

To run the tests, run the following command:

npm test

Spec Compliance and Time Spent:
I completed all parts of the spec, including implementing the required endpoints and validation logic, and writing unit tests. I spent approximately 2 hours on this project.

Challenges:
One challenge I encountered was setting up the docker server for db.
